    <h2 class="large-project-header">Tech has been slow to come in the education realm.</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Currently, music educators use outdated technology and paper forms to register their students for festivals. The system they currently have is being phased out. Many of the steps they have to take are repetitive, and communication often takes a back seat to just getting it done. Missed deadlines, missing forms, and confusion about dates and times are common.
        Teachers love what they do, but being required to spend hours of unpaid time to use an outdated, frustrating system can lower morale and passion for their profession.
