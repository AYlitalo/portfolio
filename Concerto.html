    <h2 class="large-project-header">Music educators are some of the busiest professionals,
      even by teaching standards.</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">They can have 1-3 full classes a day, with up
      to 6-8 lessons on top of that, as well as after-school electives and school
      musicals. Studies also estimate that 1 in 5 teachers have a second job as well,
      a fact that reinforces how important saving time is for teachers in general. The
      lack of down time means that when teachers need to register students or upcoming
      educational music festivals, they often take hours of unpaid time to input and
      confirm repetitive information into an outdated system.

    <h3 class="small-project-header">The Problem ☟</<h3>

    <h2 class="large-project-header">Tech has been slow to come in the education realm.</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Currently, educators use outdated technology and
      paper forms to register their students for festivals. Tech has been slow to
      come in the education world, and the system they currently have is being phased
      out (SoloChair). Many of the steps they have to take are repetitive, and
      communication often takes a back seat to just getting it done. Missed deadlines,
      missing forms, and confusion about dates and times are common.
</p>
      <p class="project-paragraph"> Teachers love what they do, but being required to
        spend hours of unpaid time to use an outdated, frustrating system can lower morale
        and passion for their profession.

    <h2 class="large-project-header">Work Smarter, Not Harder.</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
      The goal is to make teacher’s lives easier, less stressful,  more organized,
      and to save them unnecessary hours by reducing the amount of effort and confusion
      it takes to get students from practicing in the classroom to performing in festivals.

    <h2 class="large-project-header">Concerto</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
      Concerto is a web application that allows teachers to accumulate their student’s
      data online, allowing them to nimbly register students for festivals, as well as
      manage and keep information up to date to use in coming years.
    </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
By moving from a combination hard copy/digital submission that the teacher fills out
alone new every year, to a system that has students submit their personal information
to the web app that saves info for the teacher to have for the next festival, the teacher
 will save time, gain a record system, and have improved communication with students and colleagues.

    <h3 class="small-project-header">Design ☟</<h3>

    <h2 class="large-project-header">Sketches</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
      First round of bringing the concept into something testable was hand drawn
      sketches. I tested users that were in my target audience (public school music teachers).
      This allowed me to test my hypothesis early without putting hours of design or
      development time in.
    </p>


    <p class="list-title-bump-down">
<b>Comments Included:</b>
    </p>
<ul>
    <li class="project-paragraph project-paragraph-list-element">
      Registering multiple students (currently a search box and multi select)
      could be easier when selecting checkboxes from a big list, rather than searching,
      since a lot of teachers require participation from all students. A “select all”
      feature would be amazing.
    </li>

    <li class="project-paragraph project-paragraph-list-element">
      Class lists aren’t always the most important way of viewing students. A big
      all inclusive list of students that could be further broken down could be a
      better user experience.
    </li>

    <li class="project-paragraph project-paragraph-list-element">
      Also give the ability to send a link to students when registering students to
      festivals, so that they can provide their information. Use a similar interaction
      to when you invite students to a class.
    </li>

    <li class="project-paragraph project-paragraph-list-element">
      Overall, the feedback was very positive. I got a few comments to be a bit more
      thorough with sketching in the future, so they didn’t need to guess what was on screen,
      but overall flow was easily understood.

    <h2 class="large-project-header">Wireframes</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
This stage is where a lot of the design iterations happened, as I began to fill in
the blanks on the screen to match up with the user flow. Buttons appeared, moved, got
deleted, and tossed back in as I found a comfortable flow for my users to travel through.
By using quick guerrilla testing methods on some people in my circles, I was able to
knock out some quick usability issues, as well as get collaborative feedback and suggestions.

        What was the mood I wanted people to feel when using this app? At ease,
        relaxed, and trusting. I began scouting around for examples of beautiful
        SaaS applications that evoked the same feelings that I wanted my application to,
        as well as creating an eclectic Pinterest board. <b>My favorites were Google
          Classroom, ProductBoard, InVision, and Airbnb.</b>

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        I ended up with an array of colors that are charming and playful without
        being overly serious or goofy., and a beautiful round geometric san serif
        typeface (Sofia Pro) that’s modern and playful and sits well at both
        headline and body text sizes.. The brand is professional and lighthearted
        at the same time.

  <h2 class="large-project-header">High Fidelity Mocks and Prototypes</h2>

  <p class="project-paragraph">
    Based on my wireframes and UI brand guide I created some high fidelity prototypes
    to test again. I reached out to the three original individuals who I interviewed with
    to test the usability of my application. By asking them to perform simple but important
    tasks, I was able to watch them work through the flow and hear their comments and questions. 
    At this point, there were minimal confusions and users seemed to work through the flow smoothly.
  </p>

  <p class="project-paragraph">
    Taking their feedback, I edited the application with their comments in mind.

  <h2 class="large-project-header">People are hard to get for interviews and user testing.</h2>

  <p class="project-paragraph">
    The hardest part of the process was finding users in my target audience who
    actually wanted to chat with me, even when a monetary incentive was involved.
    There were many skipped apppointments, ghosting via email, and dead ends.

    It’s possible because, as mentioned when exploring the problem space, that they
    are incredible busy, and this project happened to be worked on during the spring
    semester when they are particulary short on time.
  </p>

  <p class="project-paragraph">
    For future work and iterations on this project, offering a higher incentive
    and broadening my target audience to outside of NY may help.
