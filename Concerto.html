    <h2 class="large-project-header">Music educators are some of the busiest professionals, even by teaching standards.</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">They can have 1-3 full classes a day, with up to 6-8 lessons on top of that, as well as after-school electives and school musicals. Studies also estimate that 1 in 5 teachers have a second job as well, a fact that reinforces how important saving time is for teachers in general. The lack of down time means that when teachers need to register students or upcoming educational music festivals, they often take hours of unpaid time to input and confirm repetitive information into an outdated system.

    <h3 class="small-project-header">The Problem ☟</<h3>

    <h2 class="large-project-header">Tech has been slow to come in the education realm.</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Currently, educators use outdated technology and paper forms to register their students for festivals. Tech has been slow to come in the education world, and the system they currently have is being phased out (SoloChair). Many of the steps they have to take are repetitive, and communication often takes a back seat to just getting it done. Missed deadlines, missing forms, and confusion about dates and times are common.
</p>
      <p class="project-paragraph"> Teachers love what they do, but being required to spend hours of unpaid time to use an outdated, frustrating system can lower morale and passion for their profession.

    <h2 class="large-project-header">Work Smarter, Not Harder.</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
      The goal is to make teacher’s lives easier, less stressful,  more organized, and to save them unnecessary hours by reducing the amount of effort and confusion it takes to get students from practicing in the classroom to performing in festivals.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-information-blurb">

    <h2 class="large-project-header">Concerto</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
      Concerto is a web application that allows teachers to accumulate their student’s data online, allowing them to nimbly register students for festivals, as well as manage and keep information up to date to use in coming years.
    </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
By moving from a combination hard copy/digital submission that the teacher fills out alone new every year, to a system that has students submit their personal information to the web app that saves info for the teacher to have for the next festival, the teacher will save time, gain a record system, and have improved communication with students and colleagues.

    <h2 class="large-project-header">Discovery</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">I used a handful of tools to come up with a solidified concept. You can view my different PDF documentation of the methods below.

    <h2 class="large-project-header">Learnings and Goals</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
      After interviewing teachers, synthesizing the data, and creating personas, I felt oriented enough that I could confidently determine a few big goals to tackle with the product. 
    </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
      <ul class="project-paragraph-list">
        <li class="project-paragraph project-paragraph-list-element"><b>To reduce workload on teacher.</b> <br> By sharing the work and getting students involved in the process, it takes most of the input effort off the teacher and takes a fraction of the time. </li>
        <li class="project-paragraph project-paragraph-list-element"><b>To provide teachers better communication with other parties. </b> <br>	An announcement board and instant messaging will keep everyone on the same page with festival alerts and statuses.</li>
        <li class="project-paragraph project-paragraph-list-element"><b>To improve information organization. </b> <br> Each student will have a profile, and they will be connected to a class, group, instrument, and other sortable categories. Students will have records of past scores and participations that can be referenced, and festival status will be monitored front and center to keep the teacher on track</li>

      Exploration

    <p class="project-paragraph">
      Before beginning to visually build out the web app and user interface, I spent some time with the tools used to build out new apps concepts. You can view my exploration and documentation by clicking the buttons below.

    <h3 class="small-project-header">Design ☟</<h3>

    <h2 class="large-project-header">Sketches</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
      First round of bringing the concept into something testable was hand drawn sketches. I tested users that were in my target audience (public school music teachers). This allowed me to test my hypothesis early without putting hours of design or development time in.
    </p>


    <p class="list-title-bump-down">
<b>Comments Included:</b>
    </p>
<ul>
    <li class="project-paragraph project-paragraph-list-element">
      Registering multiple students (currently a search box and multi select) could be easier when selecting checkboxes from a big list, rather than searching, since a lot of teachers require participation from all students. A “select all” feature would be amazing.
    </li>

    <li class="project-paragraph project-paragraph-list-element">
      Class lists aren’t always the most important way of viewing students. A big all inclusive list of students that could be further broken down could be a better user experience.
    </li>

    <li class="project-paragraph project-paragraph-list-element">
      Also give the ability to send a link to students when registering students to festivals, so that they can provide their information. Use a similar interaction to when you invite students to a class.
    </li>

    <li class="project-paragraph project-paragraph-list-element">
Overall, the feedback was very positive. I got a few comments to be a bit more thorough with sketching in the future, so they didn’t need to guess what was on screen, but overall flow was easily understood.

    <h2 class="large-project-header">Wireframes</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
This stage is where a lot of the design iterations happened, as I began to fill in the blanks on the screen to match up with the user flow. Buttons appeared, moved, got deleted, and tossed back in as I found a comfortable flow for my users to travel through. By using quick guerrilla testing methods on some people in my circles, I was able to knock out some quick usability issues, as well as get collaborative feedback and suggestions.

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        What was the mood I wanted people to feel when using this app? At ease, relaxed, and trusting. I began scouting around for examples of beautiful SaaS applications that evoked the same feelings that I wanted my application to, as well as creating an eclectic Pinterest board. <b>My favorites were Google Classroom, ProductBoard, InVision, and Airbnb.</b>

        Final UI Brand Look
      </p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        I ended up with an array of colors that are charming and playful without being overly serious or goofy., and a beautiful round geometric san serif typeface (Sofia Pro) that’s modern and playful and sits well at both headline and body text sizes.. The brand is professional and lighthearted at the same time.

  <h2 class="large-project-header">High Fidelity Mocks and Prototypes</h2>

  <p class="project-paragraph">
    Based on my wireframes and UI brand guide I created some high fidelity prototypes to test again. I reached out to the three original individuals who I interviewed with to test the usability of my application. By asking them to perform simple but important tasks, I was able to watch them work through the flow and hear their comments and questions. At this point, there were minimal confusions and users seemed to work through the flow smoothly.
  </p>

  <p class="project-paragraph">
    Taking their feedback, I edited the application with their comments in mind.

  <h3 class="small-project-header">Final Thoughts ☟</<h3>

  <h2 class="large-project-header">People are hard to get for interviews and user testing.</h2>

  <p class="project-paragraph">
    The hardest part of the process was finding users in my target audience who actually wanted to chat with me, even when a monetary incentive was involved. There were many skipped apppointments, ghosting via email, and dead ends.

It’s possible because, as mentioned when exploring the problem space, that they are incredible busy, and this project happened to be worked on during the spring semester when they are particulary short on time.
  </p>

  <p class="project-paragraph">
    For future work and iterations on this project, offering a higher incentive and broadening my target audience to outside of NY may help.
